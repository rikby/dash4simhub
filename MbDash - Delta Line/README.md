# MbDash - Delta Line

## Installation

* Install dashboard [MbDash - Delta Line.simhubdash](MbDash%20-%20Delta%20Line.simhubdash) into simhub.
* Set it as an overlay if you need to.
* Copy plugin by copying PluginsData directory into Simhub root.<br>
Alternatively, you can copy it manually from the file plugin.cs in _SimHub > Additional Plugins > More > Add New Expression_.<br>
Put the code into the code field and give it a name "MbDashDeltaTime" (the name can be any).

NOTE: This script works per-game. But Simhub got some changes. So, you may give it a try. If does not work for other sims, then activate your sim, and set the code again.

P.S. I'll appreciate if let me know how installation can be done in one step. Thanks in advance.
