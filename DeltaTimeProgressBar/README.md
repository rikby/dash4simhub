# Installation
1. Copy DashTemplates directory into Simhub root (e.g. c:\Program Files (x86)\SimHub\)
2. Copy plugin by copying PluginsData directory into Simhub root.<br>
Alternatively, you can copy it manually from the file [`plugin.cs`](plugin.cs) in SimHub > Additional Plugins > More > Add New Expression.<br>
Put the code into _the code field_ and give it a name "MbDashDeltaTime" (the name can be any).
